# SimpleKalman by No Eye Deer Labs
This is a simple Kalman filter implemented in C++ for use in Arduino and
other microcontroller projects when working with noisy sensors such as
accelerometers and gyros. It is based on the very informative blog post found here: http://interactive-matter.eu/blog/2009/12/18/filtering-sensor-data-with-a-kalman-filter/
